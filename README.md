A simple dynamic list with employees from the database - **PHP MYSQL** pagination

Dynamically checks employee number, employee limit for page, find page number then makes the list.

When the list comes to the end it will check if it's on the last page dynamically then remove **NEXT** button.

If on the first page the **BACK** button disappears.
